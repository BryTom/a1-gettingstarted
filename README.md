4. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page, it displays correctly. You can do this locally by simply running `node server.js` from within the assignment directory and then going to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
5. Modify the README file according to the specification below.
6. Commit and push all your changes to GitHub. 
7. Deploy your project to Glitch. You can do this by [importing the repo from GitHub](https://medium.com/glitch/import-code-from-anywhere-83fb60ea4875). Note the following:
	* You will need to create a Glitch account first, but Glitch makes it easy by giving you the option to log in via your GitHub account.
	* The instructions in the medium.com post are slightly outdated. To import your GitHub repo, select `Import from GitHub` under `New Project`.
8. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme (guide follows) so we can find it.
9. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo. This helps us find your project.
	* Ignore any messages about conflicts. You do not need to resolve them.
	* Make the title of your pull request "Pull Request for NAME" (ex. "Pull Request for Joshua Cuneo")

Naming and URL Scheme
---

You must use a consistent naming scheme for all projects in this course.
If we can't find it, we can't grade it.

By default Glitch often assigns your application a random name. To change it, click on the project dropdown menu in the upper left corner of Glitch. You will then see an additional text field displaying the project name in the resulting menu; click here to edit the name.

The name scheme should be `a1-yourFirstAndLastName`.
The `a1` will need to be updated to `a2`, `a3`, and so on in future assignments.

Rubric
---
For the Technical and Design achievements, make sure you thoroughly describe in your README what you did why it was challenging. ALL ACHIEVEMENTS MUST BE DESCRIBED IN YOUR README IN ORDER TO GET CREDIT FOR THEM. Remember that the success of Achievements hinges on how well you describe them in your README. Well formatted text, images, and concise and clear descriptions are helpful. You must include a Technical Achievements and Design Achievements section, even if none are attempted.

Note that if you want to load resources besides your index.html file (images, an CSS file, a JS file) you'll need to modify server.js to point to these. For now it's easiest to just hardcode paths to the resources, but we'll look at ways to optimize this shortly.

*Basic Requirements*

(10 points each)

1. Assignment has proper naming scheme
2. Files forked from original repo
3. `index.html` properly rendered
4. `index.html` page properly edited
5. All changes pushed to GitHub
6. Project deployed to Glitch (or other hosting option)
7. Pull Request submitted to original repo

*Technical Achievements*
1. (5 points) Style your page using CSS. Each style rule you apply will get you 1 point for a maximum of 5 points. Be sure to describe your style rules in your README.
2. (5 points) Add a simple JavaScript animation to the page.
3. (5 points) Experiment with other *semantic* HTML tags (links, images, tables, header, footer, etc.). Each extra tag you use will get you 1 point for a maximum of 5 points. Be sure to describe the tags you use in your README.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, h1/2, ul, footer, and various article and image classes. As someone unfamiliar with html, it was challenging to discover what style rules existed and trying to implement them in a reasonably aesthetic manner.
- **TODO**
- **Exerimented with other HTML tags**: Utilized images, articles, links, headers, and footers. This was challening as I had to look into what tags existed as well as when to use them. For example, using headers and footers versus just implementing every section of the page as an article was a distinction I read out about and decided on.

## Design Achievements
- **Used a palette created from Adobe Color**: I used a warmer color palette for my website, with the image for the colour codes in the resources folder. I tried to pick out a reasonably nice palette in warmer, WPI colours. I don't quite like how they blended, so I'll be looking more into colour theory in the future.
- **Used a font from Google Fonts**: I used Courier Prime for the primary text in my site, with Impact as the header font. I've always liked Impact as a font, despite how unprofessional it would be in an academic paper, so I ended up searching Google fonts for a complementary font.
